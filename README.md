# meteorology-portfolio
Portfolio of meteorology, data science, and geospatial analytics projects â€” featuring Python pipelines, forecast verification tools, and geospatial visualization solutions for research, energy, and transportation applications.

# David Levin â€“ Meteorology & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!  
Iâ€™m a **meteorologist and data scientist** with expertise in **Python**, **cloud-based workflows**, and **geospatial analysis**. Over the past decade with the National Weather Service, Iâ€™ve developed scalable tools for automating weather data pipelines, building verification systems, and delivering actionable insights through dashboards and visualizations.

This repository showcases **sanitized examples** of my work for clients, research, and operational forecasting.

## **Featured Projects**

### **1. Automated Forecast Archive**
- **Tech stack:** Python, AWS S3, Pandas, Parquet, fsspec  
- Developed a **parallelized Python pipeline** to archive **NDFD**, **HRRR**, **RRFS** and **NBM** forecasts.  
- Uses partitioned Parquet files for efficient storage and query-ready datasets.  
- **Demo:** [https://github.com/david-levin11/meteorology-portfolio/tree/main/alaska_verification_portfolio]  
- **Highlights:**  
  - 70% faster processing  
  - Scalable and cloud-friendly design  
  - Reusable class structure for multiple data sources

---

### **2. Forecast Verification Tool**
- **Tech stack:** Python, DuckDB, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Modular verification system to analyze model accuracy, generate **bias/confusion matrices**, and visualize category-based performance (e.g., Beaufort bins).  
- **Demo:** [Link to notebook or repo directory]  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Flexible binning schemes  
  - Clean, publication-ready visualizations  
  - Supports large datasets with low memory footprint

### **3. Geospatial Snowfall Mapping**
- **Tech stack:** Arcpy, GeoPandas, Python
- Designed **automated geospatial snowfall analysis** to visualize spatial extend of sparse observations using Empirical Bayesian Krieging Regression Analysis to smartly spread out snowfall observations based on climatology.  
- **Demo:** [Screenshot or hosted link]  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Used to verify National Weather Service warning products and for public dissemenation post major events.  
  - Modular design adaptable to multiple regions.
