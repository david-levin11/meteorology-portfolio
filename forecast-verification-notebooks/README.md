# Forecast Verification Notebooks

This folder contains examples and demos of my on-the-fly verification notebooks built in Google Colab. These tools allow meteorologists and researchers to quickly analyze the performance of numerical guidance at specific sites or across geospatial domains, without the need for complex setups or heavy local computing resources.

## Highlights
- Rapid location- and region-specific verification
- Flexible binning schemes, including Beaufort scale and custom thresholds
- Clean, publication-ready visualizations
- Scalable workflows that handle large datasets efficiently
